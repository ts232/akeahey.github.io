<h1 class = "center">Which Translation of <i>Les Miserables</i> Is The Best?</h1>
<h4 class = "center">As a long time lover of <i>Les Miserables</i>, a discussion with a friend about the thematic differences between the English and French versions of the novel got me thinking: could the translation of the novel from French to English has altered it's emotional meaning? Are some translations better than others at staying true to Hugo's original emotional intent?</h4>
<p>In order to explore this question, I ran two English translations of Les Mis through sentiment analysis in R and compared them to the results of the same process on the original French.</p>
<p>Below is a side by side comparison of the basic positive/negative sentiment of the two English translations, using the same nrc database for sentiment. Clearly, these graphs show that a difference exists between the two translations in terms of overall sentiment.</p>

<p><b>A Personal Note:</b></p>
<p>After this data exploration, I also offer my own, subjective measure of a translation's value.</p>
<p>In chapter VI of Book I of Volume IV, Enjolras says "be serious," a line which is translated the same way in every translation from the original "<i>sois serieux</i>".</p>
<p>However, in the next line, Grantaire responds "<i>je suis farouche</i>," which has been translated many different ways, including "timid" (Wraxal, 1887), "wild" (Hapgood, 1862), and "unflinching" (Denny, 1976).</p>
<p>The meaning of the French word <i>farouche</i> lies somewhere between the English "feral" and "shy"- like a cornered, untamed animal that recoils from being touched.</p>
<p>Given this definition and the context in which it is said, Hapgood's translation to "wild" seems to be the most accurate. </p>
<p>While one word is not enough to write a translation's sentence, this particular line is beloved by many fans of <i>Les Miserables</i>, including myself, and gives it a special commemoration in the eyes of dedicated readers.</p>

<p><b>Future goals for this project include:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Finishing the French sentiment analysis for comparison</li>
  <li>Finding for text files for other translations!</li>
  <li>To what extent can sentiment analysis account for overall emotional tone in an analysis like this?</li>
  <li>Why might these differences between translations/the original exist?</li>
</ul>
