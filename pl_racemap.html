<h1>Premier League Table Race Map</h1>
<p>This project, inspired by some of my favourite formula one race visualizations, will create a "racemap" of the premier league season based on standings each week. </p>
<p>Already, the steady standing of Liverpool at first position, the fall of Tottenham, the surprising rise of newly promoted Sheffield United, and the chaos of week 12 are creating interesting questions: </p>
<p>Compared to other seasons, how typical is this year's pattern of movement on the table?</p>
<ul>
<li>After which week are the relative positions of teams mostly set?
  <ul><li>Currently working on a web scraper to collect data from past seasons</li>
      <li>Also hoping to create an interactive tool to compare seasons with d3.js</li></ul></li>
<li>After which week are the relative positions of teams mostly set?
  <ul><li>Would also be interesting to compare points over each season to compare breakaways</li></ul></li>
</ul>
